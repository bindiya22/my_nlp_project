Retail warehouses, also known as distribution centers or fulfillment centers,
are facilities used by retailers for storing and distributing goods to their stores
or directly to customers. These warehouses play a crucial role in the supply
chain, ensuring that products are available when and where they are needed.
This paper explores, through a literature review, the significant role played
by deep learning in modern retail warehouses, primarily in optimizing various
aspects of warehouse operations. Some real-life case studies have also been
examined to understand the benefits, prospects and challenges. The paper will
be of use for academicians, industrialists and policymakers as it provides
insights into real-time implementation of deep learning applications.
Introduction
Deep learning is rapidly being used in modern retail warehouses to improve many
elements of warehouse operations, maximize efficiency, and boost overall performance.
The use of deep learning techniques in modern retail warehouses has sparked
widespread interest due to its potential to improve efficiency and optimize different
areas of warehouse operations. This paper provides a review of current research on
the use of deep learning in retail warehousing, with an emphasis on key aspects such
as inventory management, warehouse automation, quality control, and customer
experience. Intelligent computer applications are currently used in a variety of fields,
including retail businesses. Customer behavior analysis is becoming increasingly
important for both customers and companies. In this context, the unique concept of
remote gaze estimate using deep learning has demonstrated promising results in
analyzing client behavior in retail due to its scalability, resilience, cheap cost, and
continuous nature.

tasks in warehouses nowadays and at the same time one of the hardest to automate.
Technical progress in automation technologies, however, allowed for first robotic products
on fully automated picking in certain applications (LeCun et al., 2015). The intention
of product recognition is to facilitate the management of retail products and improve
consumers’ shopping experience. At present, barcode recognition is the most widely
used technology not only in research but also in industries where automatic identification
of commodities is used. By scanning barcode marks on each product package, the
management of products can be easily facilitated. Normally, almost every item on the
market has its corresponding barcode (Wei et al., 2020).
Autonomous systems for monitoring and surveying are increasingly used in retail
stores, since they improve the overall performance of the store and reduce manpower
cost. Moreover, an automated system improves the accuracy of collected data by avoiding
human-related factors. This paper presents ROCKy, a mobile robot for data collection
and surveying in a retail store that autonomously navigates and monitors store shelves
based on real-time store heat maps; ROCKy is designed to automatically detect shelf
out of stock (SOOS) and promotional activities (PA) based on deep convolutional neural
networks (DCNNs) (Marina et al., 2019).
Despite heightened interest, integrating AI into businesses remains challenging.
Recent surveys show that up to 85% of AI initiatives ultimately fail to deliver on their
promises. Studies on successful AI applications that could provide invaluable lessons
for organizations embarking on their AI journey are still lacking. Therefore, this study
aims to understand how AI technology, people, and processes should be managed to
successfully create value. Building on the resource orchestration perspective, this study
analyzes the successful applications of AI at Alibaba’s e-commerce fulfilment center.
The findings indicate that the key AI resources include data, AI algorithms, and robots.
These resources must be orchestrated (e.g., coordinated, leveraged, deployed) to work
with other related resources, such as warehouse facilities and existing information systems,
to generate strong AI capabilities (Dan et al.,2021). With continuous improvements in
performance of microprocessors over the years, they now possess capabilities of
supercomputers of earlier decade. Further the continuous increase in the packaging
density on the silicon and general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)
enhancements has led to utilization of deep learning (DL) techniques, which had lost
steam during the last decade (Dutta, 2018).
Human-computer interaction holds the key to technical improvement in logistics
and supply chain. The primary issues are the degree of energy supplied to devices,
such as automated cars and robotic equipment, and lack of belief in intelligent decision-
making, which may override the system in the event of misperceptions of automated
decisions (Abosuliman and Almagrabi, 2021). In today’s digital environment, any
organization that deals with large amounts of data via warehouse management systems
Deep Learning Tools for Modern Retail Warehouses: A Literature Review 37(WMS) is a crucial component. Furthermore, the volume and complexity of data
generated make it increasingly difficult to maintain WMS efficiency. As a result, a
technology capable of managing such intricacies without human intervention is
necessary (Wang et al., 2022). Order picking is one of the most expensive jobs in
today’s warehouses, as well as the most difficult to automate. However, technological
advancements in automation technologies enabled the development of the first robotic
devices capable of fully automated picking in specific applications (Bormann et al.,
2019).
Inventory Management
Automated Stock Counting
Deep learning-based automated stock counting has been investigated as a technique
for reducing inventory tracking errors. Smith et al. (2018) proved the usefulness of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in precisely counting and monitoring stock
levels by analyzing photos from warehouse cameras.
Demand Forecasting
Accurate demand forecasting is essential for optimizing stock levels. Li and Wang
(2019) suggested a deep learning-based model that combines past sales data, external
factors, and current inventory levels to generate more accurate demand estimates and
decrease stockouts and excess inventory.
Robotic Picking Systems
Deep learning algorithms play an important role in robotic picking operations. Johnson
and Garcia (2020) discovered that merging computer vision and deep neural networks
Author, pl allows robots to recognize and collect products from shelves with great precision,
c h e c k ,
increasing the efficiency of order fulfillment procedures. Robotic picking systems use
robots with vision systems and manipulators to recognize, grip, and transfer things
from warehouse shelves to order fulfillment stations (Kovalenko et al., 2019). Kovalenko
et al. (2019) sought to improve picking accuracy, speed, and flexibility in current retail
warehouses, which are dynamic and complex environments. Robotic picking systems
rely heavily on computer vision since it allows robots to detect and comprehend their
surroundings. Jones and Wang (2018) successfully combined computer vision techniques
such as object recognition and depth sensing to increase item identification accuracy
in congested warehouse environments.
Deep learning techniques have been used to improve the item detection capabilities
of robotic picking systems. Wang and Chen (2020) used CNNs to enable robots to
properly detect and classify varied items, even in scenarios with changing lighting
conditions and object orientations. Human-robot collaboration in the picking process
has been investigated in order to maximize both parties’ strengths. Smith and Kim
(2017) developed a collaborative picking technique in which robots execute repetitive
38 The IUP Journal of Operations Management, Vol. 23, No. 3, 2024and physically hard jobs, while humans concentrate on more complicated decision-
making and quality control aspects. Human-robot collaboration in the selection process
has been investigated in order to harness both their strengths. Scalability is an important
consideration for the practical usage of robotic picking systems in large-scale warehouse
operations. Liu et al. (2021) explored the challenges and solutions associated with scaling
up robotic picking systems, namely, system coordination, task distribution, and network
communication. Integrating robotic picking systems into existing warehouse management
systems is a difficult issue. Brown and Zhang (2018) investigated the obstacles and
techniques for seamless integration, emphasizing the importance of standardized
communication protocols and modular architectures to improve interoperability.
Automated Sorting
Automated sorting systems use deep learning to recognize and classify things based
on a variety of criteria. Chen et al. (2021) demonstrated the use of deep learning for
real-time sorting by optimizing the sorting process based on size, shape, and
destination. Automated sorting involves categorizing and organizing goods based on
specified criteria using technologies such as conveyor systems, sensors, and robotic
arms (Chen et al., 2020). The incorporation of automation into sorting processes seeks
to reduce errors, enhance throughput, and improve overall warehouse efficiency.
Dynamic sorting, which sorts things depending on real-time parameters like demand,
has gained popularity. Wang and Chen (2021) proposed a machine learning approach
that adjusts sorting algorithms to changing demand patterns, resulting in more flexible
and responsive sorting systems.
Robotic sorting systems use robotic arms with grippers to pick and deposit objects
into preset bins. Brown and Smith (2017) investigated the advantages of utilizing
robotic arms for high-speed and precision sorting, emphasizing robots’ versatility to
handling a wide range of goods. Collaboration between humans and robots has
been researched to improve the capabilities of robotic sorting systems. Kim et al.
(2020) developed a collaborative sorting approach in which robots operate alongside
human operators, combining automation efficiency with human decision-making in
difficult sorting scenarios Scalability remains an issue when deploying automated
sorting systems for large-scale warehouses. Liu et al. (2022) explored improvements
in system design and control algorithms to solve scalability issues, ensuring that
sorting systems can manage rising volumes of various items. Integration with existing
warehouse management systems is critical to the smooth operation of sorting systems.
Chen and Wang (2017) explored the problems and suggested solutions for integrating
automated sorting systems with warehouse management systems, highlighting the
importance of standardized communication protocols. There has been research on
the environmental impact of automated sorting systems. Brown and Zhang (2021)
talked about sustainable sorting strategies, including energy-efficient algorithms,
recyclable materials in conveyor systems, and reducing waste generated during the
sorting process.
Deep Learning Tools for Modern Retail Warehouses: A Literature Review 39Quality Control
Visual Inspection
Deep learning models were utilized to automate visual inspection tasks in retail
warehouses. Kim and Park (2017), for example, developed a deep learning-based
visual inspection system to detect flaws or anomalies in products, ensuring that clients
only receive high-quality items. Visual inspection is the use of visual cues to assess
the quality and integrity of products in retail warehouses. Traditional visual inspection
by human operators is time-consuming and unpredictable. The use of computer vision
technologies is intended to automate and improve the visual inspection process. Product
flaws and anomalies have been identified using computer vision techniques such as
image recognition. Kim et al. (2018) used CNNs for image-based defect identification
and achieved high accuracy in detecting minor flaws in products during visual
inspection. Visual inspection is essential not merely for spotting faults, but also for
categorizing things based on their visual attributes. Zhang and Wang (2019) investigated
the application of object recognition algorithms to efficiently identify and sort products,
thereby optimizing warehouse operations. Visual inspection is used not just to detect
faults, but also to categorize objects based on their visual characteristics. Zhang and
Wang (2019) studied the use of object recognition algorithms to efficiently identify and
sort products, resulting in streamlined warehouse operations. Robotic and visual
inspection approaches have been combined to increase inspection speed and efficiency.
Chen and Liu (2020) proposed a robotic visual inspection system that uses computer
vision and robotic arms to automate product inspection on conveyor belts, enhancing
overall throughput. Real-time feedback mechanisms have been prioritized to improve
the adaptability of visual inspection systems. Wang et al. (2021) explored using real-
time feedback, such as machine learning algorithms, to dynamically alter inspection
criteria depending on changing product specifications and quality requirements.
Adaptive inspection strategies, in which inspection parameters are changed to account
for product variability, have been proposed. Liu et al. (2019) investigated the
development of adaptive visual inspection systems that can accept fluctuations in product
appearance while lowering false positives and negatives.
Predictive Maintenance
Equipment Monitoring
Predictive maintenance is critical for reducing downtime in warehouses. Smith and
Jones (2019) used deep learning models to analyze sensor data from warehouse
machines, anticipating equipment breakdowns and allowing for preventive
maintenance. Equipment monitoring is the constant collecting and analysis of data
from sensors linked to various warehouse gear, such as conveyors, forklifts, and
automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS). The purpose is to identify
abnormalities, forecast possible failures, and optimize maintenance techniques to save
downtime.
40 The IUP Journal of Operations Management, Vol. 23, No. 3, 2024The use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor networks has been investigated
for real-time equipment monitoring. Zhou et al. (2018) proved the efficiency of putting
a network of sensors on essential warehouse equipment, allowing for continuous data
collecting and remote monitoring. Vibration sensors are commonly used for predictive
maintenance of spinning machinery. Wang et al. (2019) used machine learning
techniques to analyze vibration patterns and anticipate equipment breakdowns before
they occurred.
Machine learning has been used to forecast equipment defects and breakdowns.
Lee et al. (2020) created a predictive maintenance model that combines past equipment
performance data with environmental parameters, allowing for the prompt detection
of possible difficulties and the scheduling of preventative maintenance. Prognostics,
which involves estimating the remaining usable life (RUL) of equipment, has gained
popularity. Chen et al. (2021) introduced a prognostics system that uses sensor data
and sophisticated algorithms to produce precise RUL estimations, enabling more efficient
maintenance planning and resource allocation. The combination of equipment
monitoring systems with computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS)
has been investigated. Xiao et al. (2019) emphasized the advantages of seamless
integration, such as automatic work order production, maintenance job prioritization,
and historical data analysis for ongoing development. Remote monitoring and
diagnostics based on equipment monitoring data have been emphasized to enable
rapid decision-making. Shaik et al. (2022) reported a case study in which remote
monitoring enabled real-time diagnosis of conveyor system difficulties, resulting in
speedy remedies and minimal impact on warehouse operations.
Challenges
Challenges in handling diverse product types have been identified. Smith and Chen
(2022) discussed the need for research to address the complexities of visual inspection
across a wide range of products, considering variations in shape, color, and material.
Integration with quality management systems is crucial for the seamless operation of
visual inspection processes. Kim and Zhang (2021) highlighted the challenges and
potential solutions for integrating visual inspection systems with existing quality
management systems to ensure consistency and traceability.
The literature identifies challenges related to data security and privacy in
equipment monitoring. Chen et al. (2023) discussed the importance of implementing
secure communication protocols and data encryption to address concerns associated
with the collection and transmission of sensitive equipment data. Future research
directions involve the integration of advanced technologies, such as AI and edge
computing, to enhance the capabilities of equipment monitoring systems. Wang and
Li (2024) proposed a conceptual framework that incorporates edge computing for
real-time analytics and decision-making, reducing latency in equipment monitoring
responses.
