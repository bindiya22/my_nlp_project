discoveries in clinical practice even with the abundance of
data and technical developments. The study groups the studies
into areas including environmental exposures, atopic illnesses,
respiratory disease diagnostics, and asthma heterogeneity.
Improvement in diagnostic accuracy and identification of
asthma subtypes and biomarkers have been demonstrated by
the application of ML and AI. But because of worries about
accuracy, dependability, and interpretability, these
technologies are still seldom used in clinical environments. To
fully use big data and contemporary analytics, the paper
highlights the requirement of integrated, multidisciplinary
teams that guarantee significant clinical insights and
improvements in asthma care and treatment. To help better
understand and treat asthma, the paper ends by arguing for a
balance between explanatory and predictive models.

characteristics such as Pains, Nasal Congestion, and Runny
Nose in order to capture other symptoms that are commonly
experienced. Other properties, such as None_Experiencing,
are used to indicate circumstances in which the patient did not
experience any symptoms. Age-related characteristics are
broken down into the following age categories: Age_0-9,
Age_10-19, Age_20-24, Age_25-59, and Age_60+. This
allows for the classification of individuals into distinct age
groups. Information pertaining to gender is included in the
dataset by means of the Gender_Female and Gender_Male
characteristics. Last but not least, the severity of the disease is
categorised using qualities such as Severity_Mild,
Severity_Moderate, and Severity_None. These qualities,
when taken as a whole, offer a thorough picture of the many
different elements that were taken into consideration in the
dataset. The dataset contains an equal number of males and
females, with each gender having 105,600 entries.
