IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The new “MIBOT” application has been tested with sick
people. They used Chatbots to check the state of their health.
The Chatbot is designed to integrate with a web browser. The
presence of a cold fever is characterized by symptoms such as
coughing, headaches, body aches. On the basis of those
symptoms, the MIBOT was able to correctly predict cold fever
based on the dataset. The dataset and training requirements vary
between different algorithms. Different algorithms have
