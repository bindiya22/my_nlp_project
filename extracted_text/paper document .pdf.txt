Abstract: Daily, several news agencies publish thousands of articles concerning many events of all types (political,
economic, cultural, etc.). The decision-makers find themselves in front of a great number of events, a few of which
concern them. The automatic treatment of such events becomes increasingly necessary. Thus, we propose a
machine learning-based approach that allows annotating news articles to generate an automatic summary of the
events. We propose a new similarity measurement between events and we validate our approach by the development
of the "AnnotEv" system.
