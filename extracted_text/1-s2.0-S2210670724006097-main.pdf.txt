ensemble tree-based models and deep neural networks were considered and compared. Models were trained to
predict these health outcomes using various meteorological, regional and temporal predictors across all regions.
Our results showed that deep learning models were the most promising, with out-of-sample R2 of >60 % for most
of the studied health outcomes. However, ensemble tree-based approaches also had the best performance for
some health outcomes, and were more sensitive to weather variables and to heatwaves. By introducing novel ML-
based tools for predicting heat risks in several regions, this study can guide climate change adaptation and help
cities and society to become more healthy, resilient and sustainable.
