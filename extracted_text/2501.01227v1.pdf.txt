Robinson [13] harnessed LDA to extract topics from
aviation safety reports and identify emerging safety concerns.
Similarly, Ahadh et al. [5] delved into topic modelling to
categorize narratives in aviation accident reports, furnishing a
structured representation of accident data. [2] made use of
text-mining techniques to analyze aviation accident reports,
with a focus on identifying significant terms and phrases,
thereby establishing the groundwork for the application of
computational methods in accident report analysis. Zhong et
al. [20] introduced a framework that seamlessly melded text
mining and machine learning, enabling the automatedFrequency (TF-IDF) and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec).
TF-IDF quantifies term importance within the narratives,
capturing the semantic meaning of words. Word2Vec
represents words as dense vectors, allowing models to
understand semantic relationships. Additional preprocessing
steps included the removal of HTML tags, non-alphanumeric
characters, and other irrelevant elements. Consistent
lowercase conversion and stopword removal reduced noise,
and tokenization created a suitable corpus. Finally,
lemmatization reduced words to their base forms, improving
topic modelling interpretability.
These comprehensive preprocessing and feature
extraction steps ensure the textual data is transformed into a
suitable format for subsequent topic modelling, leading to a
more robust analysis of aviation accident reports.
C. Topic Modelling Procedure
After thorough text preprocessing, the next crucial steps
involve transforming the preprocessed textual data into
numerical features suitable for topic modelling techniques;
pLSA, LSA, LDA, and NMF. Each technique was
Fig. 1. Methodological framework implemented separately, and topics were extracted from the
dataset as shown in Fig. 1.
The preprocessed textual data were skillfully transformed
into a Document-Term Frequency Matrix. This matrix plays
a pivotal role in representing the frequency of each word
across all narratives contained in the accident reports.
Essentially, it provides a structured numerical representation
of the textual data, facilitating the subsequent topic modelling
process.
1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
For the task of topic modelling, we harnessed the
capabilities of LDA. LDA, a probabilistic generative model, is
built upon the fundamental assumption that documents
represent blends of various topics, and these topics, in turn,
comprise assortments of words. LDA's reputation as a stalwart
in the realm of topic modelling is well-documented [14]. This
model stands out for its proficiency in unveiling the concealed
thematic architectures inherent in textual data, rendering it an
intuitive selection for our analytical endeavours.
