obd platform difficult address mainly user voluntarily contribute business attribute data incentive xu et al moreover platform introduces new attribute entity crowd need time submit sufficient response summary crowdsourced data significantly vary completeness timeliness frequently exhibit longtail distribution across different business prevalent imputation method imputation represents viable common approach address missing value crowd sourced data nutshell missing value often stem different mechanism missing completely random mcar missing random mar missing random mnar general mcar completely random relate available missing value mar depends available ie observed data missing data mnar implies missing value reflects missing value obd platform missing business attribute value occur due lack sufficient data contribution user missingness depends number contributing user ie reviewer instead missing value unobserved variable therefore underlying mechanism likely either mcar mar imputation method including multiple imputation softimpute knnimpute assume mcar mar thus use complete value estimate missing value without explicitly modeling underlying missing mechanism existing imputation method categorized model representation learning similaritybased modelbased method build probabilistic regression machine learning model learn data structure interattribute relationship multiple imputation represents prevalent modelbased method relies available observed value construct probabilistic model imputation replacing missing value set value derived joint conditional distribution example multiple imputation chained equation mouse imputes missing value calculating conditional distribution one attribute attribute attribute imputed yet use joint conditional distribution could generate model incompatible joint distribution cannot exist chained equation adequately reflect complex relationship among variable regression model another exemplary form modelbased method typically regress variable incomplete value complete value excluding variable missing value may effective imputing missing value overall modelbased method performance confined model structure assumption provides limited flexibility scalability representation learningbased method avoid modeling variable relationship directly instead use mapping mechanism project original incomplete data substantially reduced dimensional space impute missing value learning lowerdimensional approximation finally project approximation back original feature space example softimpute fit lowrank matrix approximation original data matrix using soft threshold singular value decomposition svd nuclear norm regularization resulting lowrank matrix approximation contains missing value reconstructs data matrix missing value imputed imputation process usually involves use linear transformation learn representation lowerdimensional space project back thejournal management information system original space imputed value deep autoencoder imputation go one step employing deep model architecture perform multiple nonlinear transformation ie mapping greater imputation performance general existing representation learningbased method use mapping mechanism learn relationship among attri bute value often struggle capture relationship instance level crucial effective imputation similaritybased method impute missing value basis instancelevel similarity similar instance get selected according similarity measure complete value serve impute missing value focal instance exemplary similaritybased method depend variable iteration variablebased method us complete variable value assess instance similarity whereas iterative based method calculates similarity according variable value update imputed value iteratively important challenge similaritybased method calculated similarity might inaccurate due presence missing value similarity measurement also sensitive data sparsity tends suffer dimensionality issue computational complexity greatly increase highdimensional space research gap review extant literature reveals two important gap first existing imputation method tend ignore relationship among instance eg business conceivably business obd platform face similar institutional environment could learn one anothers decision practice thereby leading knowledge transfer homogenization result attribute value might related degree unique perspective suggests consideration interbusiness relation ship imputing missing business attribute value however overlooked previous research second many imputation method oversimplify relationship among variable due model structure scalability flexibility constraint eg regression probabilistic model crowdsourced data enormous volume could substantial missing value business attribute differ data type eg catego rical numerical attribute might relate intricate way example restaurant attribute good group might imply good dinner jointly challenging characteristic favor use deep learning capture complex relation ship subtle pattern important missing value imputation increasing scalability fitting ability flexibility alleviate gap develop novel deep learningbased imputation method enhance crowdsourced business attribute data obd platform proposed method novel three respect first guided institutional theory method leverage interbusiness relationship impute missing attribute value individual business analyzes common customer among different business identify related business integrates observed value related business attention mechanism unlike similaritybased method rely attribute value assess similarity among business method take network approach scrutinize interbusiness relationship second proposed

scenario feature essential subtle interattribute interbusiness relationship would facilitate effort leverage datadriven analytics improved service even example appli cation method health care analytics might impute missing value clinical data create valuable insight patient health care provider third produce empirical result evince proposed method effectiveness missing value imputation business recommendation evaluation includes several outofsample testing data set created different removal ratio examines predictive efficacy complete data set imputed methodjournal management information system versus several prevalent method supporting obd platform recommenda tions confirms importance methodological novelty ie inter business relationship emulation missing value imputation study extended several direction missing data pattern attribute value variable type might somewhat specific yelp data set use evaluate imputation effectiveness recommendation performance additional diverse data needed confirm robust performance method adopt deep model architecture fully connected layer appropriate study research consider architecture eg recurrent convolutional neural network support effective imputation along inter business relationship characteristic factor eg business category location could affect imputation effectiveness continued investigation analyze addi tional essential characteristic crowdsourced business attribute data identify factor might enhance business attribute value imputation optimal imputation performance future research also consider frequency perform imputation using data collected time moreover study assumes business attribute data mar us randomly selected observed value holdout evaluation yet missing value scenario might complex pertain mnar therefore study consider different missing mechanism assess impact imputation efficacy downstream application finally user experience satisfaction platform service eg business recommen dations essential warrant attention addition quantitative evaluation conduct research could use experimental design examine user decision making experience satisfaction platform service explicitly note
